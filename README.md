#### This is my Playground!

#### This place is made up of my favorite things.

<br>

## The reason why I made this page

<br>

- To practice Atomic Design
  - original
    - Atom
    - Molecule
    - Organism
    - Template
    - Page
  - this project (Simplified in 3 steps)
    - Atom -> Minimum size components
    - Module -> Composed of multiple Atoms, or larger than Atoms
    - Template -> Pages consisting of Modules and Atoms
  
<br>

- To practice Git-Flow
  - main -> main branch
  - gh-pages -> for gh-pages
  - develop -> for develop. All the feats start here and merge here
  - feat -> Use when creating features
  - refactor -> Used when refactoring

<br>

- Just for fun!
  - To express things that I like
